# This is a commenter project for the koii blockchain

It is supposed to write comments on designated politicians from your personal twitter account. So you run the koii project, and you get rewarded for doing something right (hopefully).

It also sends an email that proposes Kermit the frog as democratic presidential candidate (this funciton is still being worked on)

## Setup information is on the koii website (and check out their amazing docs)
